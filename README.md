**Sometimes Dev Sometimes Ops and Sometimes Both.**

Usually I present myself as a devops or backend developer but in fact I will like every stack except frontend and all graphical stuff out there.

Now Days I'm using python for my project but I would like to use go, rust and more fun stuff to improve my skills.
